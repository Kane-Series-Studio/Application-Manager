# What do I need?

There is only one thing you need! All you need to do is download python! It does not matter what version but we recomend installing the latest version to prevent backend errors and give you more accurate results!

# How is it made?

Application Manager was coded in almost all python with an exception of c# and javascript. The python calculates all the data internaly which then passes the variable value to javascript for displaying.

# What can I monitor?

You can monitor the following:

* load
* Free memory
* Used Memory
* Total Memory
* Temperature
* Computers UUID

# What does the data look like?

The data is displayed on a ui to make it easier for the user to understand, but in the backend its proccessed into a chart that is formated like this:

```
id     Name     load     free mem    used mem  total mem   temp.   uuid
```
